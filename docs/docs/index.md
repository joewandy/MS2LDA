# Welcome to the MS2LDA Documentation

MS2LDA (Mass Spectrometry–Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a framework that brings the concept of **topic modeling** to the world of **tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)**. It helps identify recurring fragmentation patterns — known as **Mass2Motifs** — that represent conserved molecular **substructures** across complex spectra.

---

## What is MS2LDA?

Traditional mass spectrometry analysis depends on spectral libraries or manual curation. MS2LDA offers a **machine learning based, data driven, and unsupervised alternative** that:

- Detects latent fragmentation motifs across large datasets.
- Aids structural elucidation of unknown compounds.
- Bridges mass spectrometry and cheminformatics.

The MS2LDA framework applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, a method originally developed for text analysis, to infer co‑occurring patterns of fragment ions and neutral losses. This allows the discovery of statistically significant patterns that often reflect chemical substructures. 🔍

## Key Features

- 🧠 **Unsupervised learning** of Mass2Motifs at unprecedented speed
- 🧬 **Automated Mass2Motif Annotation Guidance (MAG)** with Spec2Vec
- 🔗 **Integration** with MassQL-searchable MotifDB
- 📈 **Visualization app** for interactive exploration of Mass2Motifs
- 💻 **Command-line access** and **Jupyter Notebooks** for both scripted workflows and interactive data exploration
